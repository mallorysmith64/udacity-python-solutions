# Suppose you want to count from some number start_num by another number count_by until you hit a final number end_num. 
# Use break_num as the variable that you'll change each time through the loop. 
# For simplicity, assume that end_num is always larger than start_num and count_by is always positive.

# Before the loop, what do you want to set break_num equal to? How do you want to change break_num each time through the loop? 
# What condition will you use to see when it's time to stop looping?

# After the loop is done, print out break_num, showing the value that indicated it was time to stop looping. 
# It is the case that break_num should be a number that is the first number larger than end_num.

start_num = 1
end_num = 100
count_by = 2

break_num = end_num + start_num

# write a while loop that uses break_num as the ongoing number to 
#   check against end_num
while  break_num < end_num:
    break_num += count_by

print(break_num)
